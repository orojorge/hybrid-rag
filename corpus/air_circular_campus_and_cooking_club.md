The vision of Air CCCC is to transcend the traditional notion of a restaurant: a place for sharing a love of cooking and eating; a place for exploration of new recipes made from responsibly sourced ingredients; a place for engagement through the cooking academy and farming programs for the community.

Situated in Dempsey Hill, renowned as a vibrant lifestyle quarter, originated as a nutmeg plantation and subsequently transitioned into army barracks, the project site is characterized by two prominent features: a large green space and a small building.

Both in terms of scale and value, the green space is regarded as precious; it encompasses more than 90% of the property's footprint - 4000m2 - with regulations where any tree larger than 1m in girth is considered to be conserved.

On the other hand, the building, originally constructed in the early 1970s as a recreational clubhouse for civil servants, is conceived as less precious; the ‘borrowed’ design features reminiscent of modern architecture, such as white colour, clean geometrical shape - with no pitched roof - and ribbon windows, together with its modest scale- 350m2 across two floors - holds no historical value.

We started by questioning such preconceived notions of value. By implementing a coherent preservation strategy for both entities labelled as 'significant' and 'insignificant', the objective is to establish a new form of dialogue among the two.

Therefore, the physical form and appearance of the green space and the building are to be kept intact, leaving a trace of the history of the place.

From the original state, two main dysfunctional aspects require rectification: firstly, the approach from the entry point via a narrow and hidden walkway makes the building inaccessible; secondly, two staircases on the building installed outside with no rain cover are non-compliant with modern building regulations.

Rather than providing practical and functional solutions for any new interventions we introduce, the aim is to articulate the existing condition and integrate programs conventionally distributed separately.

The first intervention is the pathway: a 100 m-long, gently curved shape path - blending with the existing greenery - positioned at the center of the expansive green space. Functioning not only as a walkway connecting the parking lot to the building but also as a prelude to the project, the path marks the beginning of the journey for guests. Along this urban oasis, visitors encounter lush greenery, a newly launched farm growing fresh ingredients, a spacious open lawn for picnics, terraces for casual drinks and snacks while exploring the landscape, and gradual steps leading up to the building.

Upon arriving on the first floor, the path continuously extends into the interior of the building, maintaining its distinctive figure and material, hence highlighting its origin from the outdoor environment. Such a 'clash' initiates a symbiotic relationship with the surrounding greenery. Achieved through an operable facade system, the boundaries between indoor and outdoor spaces blur, creating a cohesive environment where the main dining area, open kitchen, and bar are seamlessly connected to the outdoors.

As guests ascend to the floor above, they encounter the second intervention: the cylinder. It is an apparatus representing the consolidation of both front-of-house and back-of-house programs, accommodating staircases for guests and staff, a bar, a preparation kitchen, and a machine room. Positioned intentionally at the rear side, away from the carefully preserved 'front,' the cylinder claims to be a foreign object, representing another aspect of the project, suggesting the potential for coexistence with the initial building state.

The second floor presents guests with a distinct ambience; a climatized space overlooking the front lawn provides a high sense of privacy.

Exposed ceilings convey a sense of rawness, while large-format lamps with organic shapes installed overhead impart a feeling of warmth.

In addition to the dining area, designated spaces are allocated for R&D, a pastry bar, a fermentation lab, and a cooking academy.

It is a hub for experimentation with new recipes and engaging with the community through a cooking academy program, open to all interested in exploring new culinary adventures.

Air CCCC's furniture and fixtures are bespoke pieces designed by Andreu Carulla, primarily sourced from leftover materials from the past exhibition, 'N*thing is Possible', curated by OMA at the National Design Center. Actively incorporating commonly used materials in the F&B industry, such as plastic bottles and styrofoam, reflects the ethos of the Air: discovering the inherent beauty in what is often perceived as waste.
